Predictive Modelling of Time Series Data using LSTM RNNs

A project that does forecasting of time series values, using normal ANNS and LSTM RNNs. The project was done using ten year's of data and seasonal trends were analyzed.

The code requires Keras and its dependencies to be installed, which can be downloaded using pip with the command 

``` pip install keras ```

## Shortcomings 
Slightly customized code with respect to the data, but can easily be adapted to any custom data. Contact me if any queries.
